# Quiz Program Ts

### User Story
* As a user, i want to be able to; \
=> Create a list of questions and options and save them. \
=> Play the quizes \
=> delete quizes. \
=> edit quizes.

### Developer Story
* As a developer, i want to be able to; \
=> allow users to Create their own quizes, play them and check their results.\
=> users should be able to invite friends to play a live quize game. \
=> users should be able to create an account via gmail.


## For this project
* The main goal is to allow a user to create quizes and play them. \
=> edit the quizes. \
=> delete the quizes. \
=> use local storage to save the quizes.


## For an advanced version of this project
* The advanced version will have features such as;
=> a database to store the quizes. (mongodb || mysql) \
=> realtime features like live games via WebSockets(ws). \
=> users create accounts in order to create quizes
=> user starts live games by activating the quize of choice and allowing players to join via a link eg.[1 3 4 5 3 6]. \
=> players don't require accounts but have to choose a nick name and enter the join in link. \
=> limit users to create up to five [5] free quizes. \
=> drag and drop for easy arrangement of quizes. \
=> for users who want to create over five [x > 5] quizes, they will have to pay a subscription fee [5 < x < 10],[10 < x < 15], [x > ...].
